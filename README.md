# Week-3-Code-Challenge

Flatdango Movie Theater is a mini web application that allows a user to browse throught the available movie options and purchase movie tickets from the theater.


## Project Deliverables
For this challenge, I worked on Flatdango, a mini web application where you can view movies and purchase tickets from the theater.

The user, is expected to be able to:
See the first movie's details (poster, title, runtime, showtime and available tickets) when the page loads.
Buy a ticket for a movie. (The number of tickets should decrease after a ticket is bought.)

Bonus Deliverables:
Click ona movie in the menu to replace the currently displayed movie's details with the new movie's details
When a movie is sold out, indicate this by changing the button to "Sold Out"
Add a sold out section for the films that are sold out

Extra Bonus Deliverables:
When a ticket is purchased, persist the updated number of tickets sold on the server.
Add a delete button next to each film that when clicked, deletes the film from the list as well as the server.


## Conclusion
Some of code-challenge deliverables were met up until the Bonus Deliverables.
After loading the page, the movie posters are displayed to the user which they can scroll and select the movie title to see more.
The CSS code was underwheming and harder to implement than I had set out to hence the app functions but it is ugly.
